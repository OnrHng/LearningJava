    hierarchy. You can change all subclass with parent class.

    Binary Search in Collection: there is a good possibilty which can use binary search with Comparable Interface.

======= MAP =========
The Map interface replace absolute dictionaries abstract class that replaces it maps.key to values. Each key has a
