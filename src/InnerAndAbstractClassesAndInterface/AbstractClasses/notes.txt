    interface ile abstract class farklari
        interface methodlarini implement etmek zorundasin. abstract class sana icindeki metodlari provide eder.
        absctract class tan extend edilmis bir classi bir kez daha abstract edip onun icinde abstract
        methodlar yazabiliriz.

        abstract classlardan instance olusturulamaz.
        interface : dont have member variable. Just all member variables should be public static final like constract
            variable with static scope. Because non static variables require an instance and cant instantiate an interface
            also cannot have a constructors. all methods in the interface automatically public. all method should be like
            abstract should be implement.
        abstract : have member variables that are inherited, have constructor. abstract class methods has any visibility.
            all method should not be abstract and also should not implement
